# Coffee Website | 2022 version

Welcome to the Coffee Website 2022 repository! This project is a simple yet comprehensive frontend web development exercise. It features various pages including a Header, Landing Page, About Page, Services Page, and Contact Page.

## Pages

This project focuses on creating a coffee-themed website to practice and showcase front-end development skills. The website includes several key sections:

- **Hero Section:** An engaging introduction to the website, designed to capture the user's attention.

- **About Page:** An informative page that provides insights into the project's background and purpose.

- **Services:** A section that outlines the services offered, adding depth to the user's understanding of the coffee experience.

- **Contact Page(Footer):** A means for users to reach out, fostering interaction and feedback.

Through this project, I aim to strengthen my front-end skills while creating an enjoyable and informative experience for visitors. This README aims to provide a clear overview of the project's scope and components.
